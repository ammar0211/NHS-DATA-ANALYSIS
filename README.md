# NHS-DATA-ANALYSIS

This was a two-part assignment project where we have to solve questions to get the correct result after analysis. We were provided with a Jupyter Notebook containing questions in the markdowns and we have to add the code blocks to get to the correct analysis in the required format. The dataset used in the assignments were of Britain's National Health Service in the JSON format.

- The first part of the assignment was done using Python only, without any use of NumPy or Pandas. It was done to test our ability to use basic Python data structures, define functions, and control program flow. We used these concepts to perform some fundamental data wrangling tasks such as joining data sets together, splitting data into groups and aggregating data into summary statistics.

- For the second part of the assignment, we used Pandas and Numpy along with the Python.  It was done to test our ability to wrangle tabular data set and aggregate large data sets into meaningful summary statistics. We used different datasets than the one used in the first path and performed more complex operations and by leveraging the power of NumPy and Pandas, we were able to represent and act on this data more efficiently compared to the first part.
